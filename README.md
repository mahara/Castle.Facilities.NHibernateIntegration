## Running the Tests

The tests run against a MSSQL Server 2008 by default.
But due to NHibernate's features, you can change the database server to any of your choice.

1. Create two databases on the database server, e.g.: "test" and "test2".

2. Modify the database connection properties in "Castle.Facilities.NHibernateIntegration.Tests" project to use the databases created.
   See "App.config" and all "**\facility.xml" files for full details.
